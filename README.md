Ardor Character Generator
=========================

What is this?
-------------

This is a practice character creator app for a fictional fantasy setting, akin
to those made to create or fill in character sheets for tabletop or
roleplaying games. For the time being, no authentication is used as it is a
personal app, but as it is developed there will be plans to use this app as a
sandbox to practice using devise. It will also be a sandbox for TDD and JQuery
practice as more advanced features are added.

Current Progress
----------------

Currently, the app still contains a very simple form to create characters
with, using carrierwave to upload character images via S3 Amazon Web Services.
Highcharts has also been implemented to practice displaying data on dynamic,
database-linked diagrams to observe data.
